                    Aquentures is a 2D puzzle game, where your goal is to unclog a pipe, which is polluting the water in people's homes. The whole game is underwater. You will drown, if you don't breathe for 15 seconds. You can replenish your oxygen on green platforms, whereas red platforms instantly kill you. You can touch pressure plates to interact with them. There are 4 levels in the game and 3 difficulties. With each harder difficulty, the amount of time you can spend in water decreases.
